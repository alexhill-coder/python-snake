# Snake

A Python remake of the game Snake where the goal is to simply collect as much food as possible. 
For this the player most change the direction of the ever moving snake to avoid hitting the edges of the screen or itself which is made more difficult as the snake expands.  

Please note that there is no end-game so close the screen to exit.

## How to Use

The file is written in standard Python that uses two modules: 
- turtle
- random

Both of these modules should be included with the standard Python libraries, so there shouldn't be any issues using these files in any Python environment.
The main file controls the screen and the calling of other elements. While the changing elements i.e. player, food, scoreboard are controlled through their namesakes.
The data.txt stores the high score of the user and can be reset as needed.
